        content: `I regret to inform you that I will be unable to attend work for the next two days due to an unforeseen and critical home repair emergency.Yesterday evening, I noticed a large damp patch on the living room ceiling, and this morning, a portion of it collapsed, revealing significant water damage likely caused by a burst pipe in the floor above.The damage is extensive, affecting not only the structural integrity of the ceiling but also the electrical wiring running through it. Given the severity of the situation, I've had to urgently call in a team of professionals, including a plumber to locate and fix the burst pipe, a structural engineer to assess the extent of the damage, and an electrician to ensure that the wiring is safe and to carry out any necessary repairs. They have advised me that the work will be extensive and will require my presence at home to oversee and facilitate the repairs.I understand the inconvenience my sudden absence may cause and I assure you that I have delegated my immediate responsibilities to my colleague, [Colleague's Name], who is well-informed about my ongoing projects and capable of handling them in my absence. Furthermore, I will be available via email and phone for any urgent queries or decisions.I apologize for this unexpected situation and the short notice.I anticipate being able to return to work as soon as the necessary repairs are completed and the safety of my home is ensured.Thank you for your understanding and support during this challenging time.`
